# Contributing to PenTest_Vault

We are excited to have you contribute to PenTest_Vault! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to this project. By participating, you agree to uphold the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) at all times.

## How to Contribute

Contributions come in different forms, from submitting issues and feature requests to writing code which improves the project directly.

### Reporting Issues

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](https://github.com/phantom0004/PenTest_Vault/issues) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible as it for helps us resolve issues faster.

### Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to [Project Name]? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Create a personal fork of the project on GitHub.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called `origin`.
- Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch to work on! Branch from `develop` if it exists, else from `main`.
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
- Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
- If the project includes tests, add one for your changes. Make sure that the test suite passes.
- Write or adapt the documentation as needed.
- Squash your commits into a single commit with git's [interactive rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#Documentation/git-rebase.txt---interactive). Create a new branch if necessary.
- Push your branch to your fork on GitHub, the remote `origin`.
- From your fork, open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's `develop` branch if there is one, else go for `main`.
- Once the pull request is approved and merged, you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es).
