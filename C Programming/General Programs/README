This collection showcases a variety of projects I've embarked on, primarily as a part of my academic assignments. 
Each program here is distinct from typical ethical hacking programs, offering a unique perspective on problem-solving and programming in C. 
Through these assignments, I've gained a wealth of knowledge and practical experience. 
Additionally, you'll find several programs that I created purely for fun. 
These personal projects have been instrumental in expanding my understanding and application of C programming, these all reflect both my educational journey and my passion for coding.
