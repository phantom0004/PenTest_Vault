# About This Project

## Course Overview

This project is derived from the specialized Udemy course, ["Build Undetectable Malware Using C Language: Ethical Hacking"](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-undetectable-malware-using-c-language-ethical-hacking/), led by **Aleksa Tamburkovski**. The curriculum focused on the development of C backdoors, introducing critical programming concepts and techniques.

## Skills and Applications

The course was instrumental in enhancing my technical expertise, particularly in the following areas:
- **Socket Connections**: Understanding and implementing network communication using sockets.
- **Windows APIs**: Leveraging Windows APIs to manipulate system processes and behaviors.
- **Reverse Shells**: Crafting reverse shells to gain remote access and control over a system.
- **TCP Protocols**: Deepening knowledge of TCP protocols to manage data transmission over networks.
- **And more**: Exploring additional aspects of system security and penetration techniques.

## Ethical Considerations

Hosted on GitHub, this collection of programs demonstrates my commitment to ethical hacking. By applying theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, I tackle real-world security challenges with integrity and responsibility.

## Instructor Acknowledgment

Guided by **Aleksa Tamburkovski**, this course offered profound insights into executing and defending against cyber attacks. His expertise not only shaped my technical skills but also reinforced the importance of ethical application in cybersecurity.
